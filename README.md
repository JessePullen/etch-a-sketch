## About the Project
This project was completed as part of the online course "The Odin Project" and was made to practice skills that have been learned so far. The primary focus of this project was DOM manipulation and is displayed through features such as:
-A dynamically generated grid that can be resized based on user input.
-Using a mouseover event handler to change properties of the individual grid items such as changing the background to a random colour and gradually decreasing the opacity.
-Resetting the grid and any changes made to the grid elements.
-Using event listeners to perform these functions.
